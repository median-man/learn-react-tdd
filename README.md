# Learn React TDD
This code is produced as a practice applying [TDD][wiki-tdd] to [React][react].

The code is wrtten as I follow [React + TDD = ðŸ’–][med-react-tdd], a post by [ADDM][med-addm] on [Medium][med].

## Tools Used
* [Jest][jest]
* [React][react]
* [Create React App][gh-create-react-app]
* [Enzyme][enzyme] (and correct [adapter package][enzyme-pkgs])

## Breif Description
Following the [post][med-react-tdd] by [ADDM][med-addm], this is an online shoe store application. A user may view a list of products, add products to the shopping cart, view the items in the cart, and filter products listed by brand.

## Going Further
After completing all the user stories described in the post by ADDM, I decided to factor out state into a separate module. The tests I had written are doing a lot of unnecessary testing of React and a lot of view details which seems like a code smell to me.

Factoring out the state will allow unit testing to stay focused on the logic and not the implementation of React or details of the view.
